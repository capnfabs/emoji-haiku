## What?

Emoji Haiku is a small program that generates nonsense poems in a 5-7-5 syllable pattern based on
the Unicode emoji descriptions.

Generate your own, bespoke haiku at [capnfabs.net/emoji-haiku](http://capnfabs.net/emoji-haiku), or follow
[@emojihaikus on twitter](http://twitter.com/emojihaikus) for one every 6 hours 😁

## How do I use it?

Alternatively, take a look at [developer_notes.md](developer_notes.md) for details about how the code works, and how to run various things.
